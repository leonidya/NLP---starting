       "'charles van doren who was later a senior editor of britannica said the ideal encyclopedia should be radical  it should stop being safe but if you know anything about the history of britannica since 1962 it was anything but radical still a very completely safe stodgy type of encyclopedia wikipedia on the other hand begins with a very radical idea and thats for all of us to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge and thats what were doing so wikipedia  you just saw the little demonstration of it  its a freely licensed encyclopedia its written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many many languages its written using wiki software  which is the type of software he just demonstrated  so anyone can quickly edit and save and it goes live on the internet immediately and everything about wikipedia is managed by virtually an allvolunteer staff so when yochai is talking about new methods of organization hes exactly describing wikipedia and what im going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside so wikipedias owned by the wikimedia foundation which i founded a nonprofit organization and our goal the core aim of the wikimedia foundation is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet and so if you think about what that means it means a lot more than just building a cool website were really interested in all the issues of the digital divide poverty worldwide empowering people everywhere to have the information that they need to make good decisions and so were going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the internet and so thats a big part of why weve chosen the free licensing model because that empowers local entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to  they can take our content and do anything they like with it  you can copy it redistribute it  and you can do it commercially or noncommercially so theres a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around wikipedia all over the world were funded by donations from the public and one of the more interesting things about that is how little money it actually takes to run wikipedia so yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was and im going to tell you what the cost of wikipedia is but first ill show you how big it is so weve got over 600000 articles in english weve got two million total articles across many many different languages the biggest languages are german japanese french  all the westerneuropean languages are quite big but only around onethird of all of our traffic to our web clusters to the english wikipedia which is surprising to a lot of people a lot of people think in a very englishcentric way on the internet but for us were truly global were in many many languages how popular weve gotten to be  were a top50 website and were more popular than the new york times so this is where we get to yochais discussion this shows the growth of wikipedia  were the blue line there  and this is the new york times over there and whats interesting about this is the new york times website is a huge enormous corporate operation with i have no idea how many hundreds of employees we have exactly one employee and that employee is our lead software developer and hes only been our employee since january 2005 all the other growth before that  so the servers are managed by a ragtag band of volunteers all the editing is done by volunteers and the way that were organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine people are always asking well whos in charge of this or who does that and the answer is anybody who wants to pitch in its a very unusual and chaotic thing weve got over 90 servers now in three locations these are managed by volunteer system administrators who are online i can go online any time of the day or night and see eight to 10 people waiting for me to ask a question or something anything about the servers you could never afford to do this in a company you could never afford to have a standby crew of people 24 hours a day and do what were doing at wikipedia so were doing around 14 billion page views monthly so its really gotten to be a huge thing and everything is managed by the volunteers and the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about 5000 dollars and thats essentially our main cost we could actually do without the employee we hired brian because he was working parttime for two years and fulltime at wikipedia so we actually hired him so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes so the big question when youve got this really chaotic organization is why isnt it all rubbish why is the website as good as it is first of all how good is it well its pretty good it isnt perfect but its much better than you would expect given our completely chaotic model so when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me you think oh this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish but when weve seen quality tests  and there havent been enough of these yet and im really encouraging people to do more comparing wikipedia to traditional things  we win hands down so a german magazine compared german wikipedia which is much much smaller than english to microsoft encarta and to brockhaus multimedial and we won across the board they hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality and we were very pleased with that result so a lot of people have heard about the wikipedia bushkerry controversy the media has covered this somewhat extensively it started out with an article in red herring the reporters called me up and they  i mean i have to say they spelled my name right but they really wanted to say the bushkerry election is so contentious its tearing apart the wikipedia community and so they quote me as saying theyre the most contentious in the history of wikipedia what i actually said is theyre not contentious at all so its a slight misquote the articles were edited quite heavily and it is true that we did have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions time magazine recently reported that extreme action sometimes has to be taken and wales locked the entries on kerry and bush for most of 2004 this came after i told the reporter that we had to lock it for  occasionally a little bit here and there so the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think we have within the wikipedia community are not really controversies at all articles on controversial topics are edited a lot but they dont cause much controversy within the community and the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality the real struggle is not between the right and the left  thats where most people assume  but its between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks and no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on either of those qualities the actual truth about the specific bushkerry incident is that the bushkerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in 2004 and it wasnt because they were contentious it was just because there was routine vandalism  which happens sometimes even on stage  sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly and i said  you know i always say please dont do that thats not a good thing so how do we do this how do we manage the quality control how does it work so theres a few elements mostly social policies and some elements of the software so the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point of view policy this is something that i set down from the very beginning as a core principle of the community thats completely not debatable its a social concept of cooperation so we dont talk a lot about truth and objectivity the reason for this is if we say were only going to write the truth about some topic that doesnt do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write because i dont agree with you about whats the truth but we have this jargon term of neutrality which has its own long history within the community which basically says any time theres a controversial issue wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue we should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it so this neutrality policy is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done so we have very diverse contributors in terms of political religious cultural backgrounds by having this firm neutrality policy which is nonnegotiable from the beginning we ensure that people can work together and that the entries dont become simply a war back and forth between the left and the right if you engage in that type of behavior youll be asked to leave the community so realtime peer review every single change on the site goes to the recent changes page so as soon as he made his change it went to the recent changes page that recent changes page was also fed into an irc channel which is an internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools and people can get rss feeds  they can get email notifications of changes and then users can set up their own personal watch list so my page is on quite a few volunteers watch lists because it is sometimes vandalized and therefore what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly and then theyll just simply revert the change theres a new pages feed for example so you can go to a certain page of wikipedia and see every new page as its created this is really important because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted you know asdfasdf but also thats some of the most interesting and fun things some of the new articles people will start an article on some interesting topic other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help and make it much better so we do have edits by anonymous users which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about wikipedia so chris was able to do his change  he didnt have to log in or anything he just went on the website and made a change but it turns out that only about 18 percent of all the edits to the website are done by anonymous users and thats a really important thing to understand the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very closeknit community of maybe 600 to 1000 people who are in constant communication and we have over 40 irc channels 40 mailing lists all these people know each other they communicate we have offline meetings these are the people who are doing the bulk of the site and they are in a sense semiprofessionals at what theyre doing the standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality we dont always meet those standards but thats what were striving for and so that tight community is who really cares for the site and these are some of the smartest people ive ever met its my job to say that but its actually true the type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people the tools and the software theres lots of tools that allow us  allow us meaning the community  to selfmonitor and to monitor all the work this is an example of a page history on flat earth and you can see some changes that were made whats nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see ok i understand now when somebody goes and looks at  they see that someone an anonymous ip number made an edit to my page that sounds suspicious who is this person somebody looks at it  they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place  to see ok well these words have changed things like this so thats one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor the history of a page another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very openended most of the social rules and the methods of work are left completely openended in the software all of that stuff is just on wiki pages and so theres nothing in the software that enforces the rules the example ive got up here is the votes for deletion page so i mentioned earlier people type asdfasdf  it needs to be deleted cases like that the administrators just delete it theres no reason to have a big argument about it but you can imagine theres a lot of other areas where the question is is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia is the information verifiable is it a hoax is it true is it what so we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to this and so the method that arose organically within the community is the votes for deletion page and in the particular example we have here its a film twisted issues and the first person says now this is supposedly a film it fails the google test miserably the google test is you look in google and see if its there because if somethings not even in google it probably doesnt exist at all its not a perfect rule but its a nice starting point for quick research so somebody says delete it please delete it  its not notable and then somebody says wait i found it i found it in a book film threat video guide the 20 underground films you must see so the next persons says clean it up somebody says ive found it on imdb keep keep keep and whats interesting about this is that the software is  these votes are just text typed into a page this is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue now it is true that at the end of the day an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say ok 18 deletes two keeps well delete it but in other cases this could be 18 deletes and two keeps and we would keep it because if those last two keeps say wait a minute nobody else saw this but i found it in a book and i found a link to a page that describes it and im going to clean it up tomorrow so please dont delete it then it would survive and it also matters who the people are who are voting like i say its a tightknit community down here at the bottom keep real movie rickk rickk is a very famous wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work with vandalism hoaxes and votes for deletion his voice carries a lot of weight within the community because he knows what hes doing so how is all this governed people really want to know about administrators things like that so the wikipedia governance model the governance of the community is a very confusing but workable mix of consensus  meaning we try not to vote on the content of articles because the majority view is not necessarily neutral  some amount of democracy  all of the administrators  these are the people who have the ability to delete pages that doesnt mean that they have the right to delete pages they still have to follow all the rules  but theyre elected by the community sometimes people  random trolls on the internet  like to accuse me of handpicking the administrators to bias the content of the encyclopedia i always laugh at this because i have no idea how theyre elected actually theres a certain amount of aristocracy you got a hint of that when i mentioned like rickks voice would carry a lot more weight than someone we dont know i give this talk sometimes with angela who was just reelected to the board from the community  to the board of the foundation with more than twice the votes of the person who didnt make it and i always embarrass her because i say well angela for example could get away with doing absolutely anything within wikipedia because shes so admired and so powerful but the irony is of course that angela can do this because shes the one person who you know would never ever break any rules of wikipedia and i also like to say shes the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia so  and then theres monarchy and thats my role on the community so  i was describing this in berlin once and the next day in the newspaper the headline said i am the queen of england and thats not exactly what i said but the point is my role in the community  within the free software world theres been a longstanding tradition of the benevolent dictator model so if you look at most of the major free software projects they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees is the benevolent dictator well i dont like the term benevolent dictator and i dont think that its my job or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge compiled by the world it just isnt appropriate but there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy a certain amount of  sometimes we have to make a decision and we dont want to get bogged down too heavily in formal decisionmaking processes so as an example of how this can be important we recently had a situation where a neonazi website discovered wikipedia and they said oh well this is horrible this jewish conspiracy of a website and were going to get certain articles deleted that we dont like and we see they have a voting process so were going to send  we have 40000 members and were going to send them over and theyre all going to vote and get these pages deleted well they managed to get 18 people to show up thats neonazi math for you they always think theyve got 40000 members when theyve got 18 but they managed to get 18 people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article of course the vote ended up being about 85 to 18 so there was no real danger to our democratic processes on the other hand people said but what are we going to do i mean this could happen what if some group gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote then i said well fuck it well just change the rules thats my job in the community to say we wont allow our openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content and so as long as people trust me in my role then thats a valid place for me of course because of the free licensing if i do a bad job the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave  i cant tell anyone what to do so the final point here is that to understand how wikipedia works its important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work but we are not fanatical web anarchists in fact were very flexible about the social methodology because ultimately the passion of the community is for the quality of the work not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it thank you ben saunders yeah hi ben saunders jimmy you mentioned impartiality being a key to wikipedias success it strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased have you found wikipedia being used by teachers and how do you see wikipedia changing education jimmy wales yeah so a lot of teachers are beginning to use wikipedia theres a media storyline about wikipedia which i think is false it builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers and the storyline is theres this crazy thing wikipedia but academics hate it and teachers hate it and that turns out to not be true the last time i got an email from a journalist saying why do academics hate wikipedia i sent it from my harvard email address because i was recently appointed a fellow there and i said well they dont all hate it but i think theres going to be huge impacts and we actually have a project that im personally really excited about which is the wikibooks project which is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages and thats a much bigger project its going to take 20 years or so to come to fruition but part of that is to fulfill our mission of giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet we dont mean were going to spam them with aolstyle cds we mean were going to give them a tool that they can use and for a lot of people in the world if i give you an encyclopedia thats written at a university level it doesnt do you any good without a whole host of literacy materials to build you up to the point where you can actually use it the wikibooks project is an effort to do that and i think that were going to see  it may not even come from us theres all kinds of innovation going on but freely licensed textbooks are the next big thing in education'"
